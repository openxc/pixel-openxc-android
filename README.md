## Dependencies

**OpenXC Libraries:** The [OpenXC Android
API](https://github.com/openxc/openxc-android handles all vehicle data
connections. The library includes [installation
instructions](http://openxcplatform.com/android/api-guide.html), example code
and additional documentation in the README file. This library is needed to
access any vehicle data.

**IOIO Libraries** The [IOIO Library](https://github.com/sudipto13/ioio) and board provides a host machine the capability of interfacing with external hardware over a variety of commonly used protocols. The original IOIO board has been specifically designed to work with Android devices. The newer IOIO-OTG ("on the go") boards work with both Android devices and PC's (details here). The IOIO board can be connected to its host over USB or Bluetooth, and provides a high-level Java API on the host side for using its I/O functions as if they were an integral part of the client. The [IOIO-wiki](https://github.com/ytai/ioio/wiki) provides further details about setting up the library and troubleshooting.
